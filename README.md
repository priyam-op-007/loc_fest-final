Loc Fest – 
“ Loc Fest ” or “ Local Festival ” - provides a platform with the idea of going #VocalForLocal and #AatmanirbharBharat by promoting the local artisans, painters, potters and other small scale busnisees, that mainly thrive on sales during festivals, to widespread their reach and make their talent known to the people, in turn gaining financial as well as social support and prevent their skills form being relenquished in this fast pacing technological world.
Every year, Diwali just like any other festivals, brings us joy and happiness. We look forward to spending time with friends and family and to celebrate the festival of lights with great enthusiasm. Light symbolizes knowledge and consciousness. 
This Diwali let us step forward to make the world a better place for ourselves and for others. Let us do something that can change the lives of others. What could be a better time than Diwali, to show our love and our concern for those who need the most?  
So, let us work together on this festival of light to overcome the problems our society still faces. 

So, here is our project “ Loc Fest ” paving ways in which your Diwali Donation can bring the good change in someone’s life.
The problem Loc Fest Solves :
•	Providing widespread reach to local artisans such as street hawkers and vendors beyond the confined bylanes of small markets.
•	Making their ingenuine handmade craft and skills known to people.
•	Providing a safer and cheaper alternative to the factory made artifical festivity materials.
•	Providing access to people to reach out to these artisans and buy their products in turn nurturing support for them and going #VocalForLocal and #AatmanirbharBharat
“ Loc Fest ” aims to solve all these problems by : creating a E-commerce platform where users do not need to search physically for these artisans in the market lanes, and have access to a wide array of these products at the comfort of their homes. 
Our platform enlists a wide ranging festive related goods such as diyas, murtis (idols), festive decoration, candles, etc that are handmade and are produced by these local level artisans. 
This is accomplished by:
•	Letting all these small-scale artisans to be registered with our network to be able to enlist and sell their product through our website/app
•	Providing the end-to-end delivery service just like E-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart, facilitating as a bridge between these small-scale sellers and the interested buyers.
•	Letting the Users support these artisans financially also by providing them tip offs and customer reviews.

Not juts Diwali, but our E-commerce platform remains operational all throughout the year, supporting these local artisans by providing them more opportunities to diversify their sales and reach, instead of just few days of work during profit making festive seasons.
